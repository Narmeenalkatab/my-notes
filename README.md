I read [good developer mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)

The artical covers some common issues in programing and how to develop a mindset that protect me from being a victim. As a beginner I will keep in my mind good developer goal should be helping people by his\her programe and not to show up . Keeping the code easy is important and the opposite doesn't mean you are intelligent .complix code could have many bugs.Also there are alot of things I should master and learn, it is not just about memorize and write commands, it is the ability to  designe a coherent programe .
